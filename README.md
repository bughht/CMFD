# CMFD

Copy-Move Forgery Detection and Localization: 
*This is a course project for media information security*

## Introduction

[Copy-Move Forgery Detection(CMFD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-move_forgery_detection) is a technique to detect and localize copy-move forgery in images. The goal of this project is to implement a CMFD algorithm in python and evaluate its performance.

## Dataset

[MICC-F220](http://lci.micc.unifi.it/labd/cmfd/MICC-F220.zip): this dataset is composed by 220 images; 110 are tampered and 110 originals.
