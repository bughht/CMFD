# CMFD

Copy-Move Forgery Detection and Localization
*This is a course project for media information security*

## Introduction

[Copy-Move Forgery Detection(CMFD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copy-move_forgery_detection) is a technique to detect and localize copy-move forgery in images. The goal of this project is to implement multiple CMFD algorithms in python and evaluate the performance.

## Dataset

[MICC-F220](http://lci.micc.unifi.it/labd/cmfd/MICC-F220.zip): this dataset is composed by 220 images; 110 are tampered and 110 originals.

## Project Goals

+ [x] Implement block-based algorithm (*it sucks because of its O(n^4) time complexity*)
+ [ ] Implement feature-point-based algorithm.
  + [x] SIFT feature
  + [ ] FAST feature
  + [ ] ORB feature
+ [ ] Implement matching algorithms
  + [x] Brute-force matching
  + [x] Fann matching
  + [ ] Hu moments matching
+ [ ] Design a model performance evaluation framework
  + [x] Torch Dataset and DataLoader wrapper
  + [ ] Model performance evaluation
