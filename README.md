# CMFD

Copy-Move Forgery Detection and Localization
*This is a course project for media information security*

## Introduction

Copy-Move Forgery Detection (CMFD) is a technique to detect and localize copy-move forgery in images. The goal of this project is to implement multiple CMFD algorithms in python and evaluate the performance.

## Dataset

[MICC-F220](http://lci.micc.unifi.it/labd/cmfd/MICC-F220.zip): this dataset is composed by 220 images; 110 are tampered and 110 originals.

## Baseline

The baseline is a sift-based algorithm implemented in Python. With current parameters, the evaluation result of this algorithm on MICC-F220 is shown below.

|              | precision | recall | f1-score | support |
| -----------: | :-------- | :----- | :------- | :------ |
| No Copy-Move | 0.88      | 0.73   | 0.80     | 110     |
|    Copy-Move | 0.77      | 0.90   | 0.83     | 110     |

+ Accuracy: 81.36%
+ Confusion-Matrix: ![cm](img/confusion-matrix.png)
